# ViteJs Expert

Focuses on the build pipeline, development server performance, and the integration of modern tooling with Vite.js.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when setting up a new project, modifying `vite.config.ts`, optimizing build times, handling static assets, or troubleshooting Hot Module Replacement (HMR) issues.

## Instructions

1.  **Configuration**: Manage `vite.config.ts` with a focus on speed and developer experience. Use appropriate plugins for React and TypeScript.
2.  **Performance Optimization**:
    -   Configure code splitting and manual chunks to optimize the production build.
    -   Optimize the dependency pre-bundling process.
3.  **Asset Handling**: Implement efficient strategies for handling CSS, images, and other static assets. Use the `public` directory vs. assets imports appropriately.
4.  **Environment Management**: Handle `.env` files and environment variable injection safely and idiomatically for Vite.
5.  **Modern Tooling Integration**: Seamlessly integrate Vite with testing frameworks (like Vitest), linting tools, and CI/CD pipelines.
