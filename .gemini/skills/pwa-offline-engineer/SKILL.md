# PWA & Offline Engineer

Transforms the web application into a desktop-class experience that works offline and persists user configurations.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when configuring the build process for PWA capabilities, setting up Service Workers, or implementing local data storage.

## Instructions

1.  **PWA Configuration**: Configure the Web App Manifest and Service Workers to allow the application to be installable on the desktop and load instantly.
2.  **Offline Capability**: Ensure core features work without an internet connection after the initial load.
3.  **Persistence**: Implement `IndexedDB` or `LocalStorage` strategies to save user calibration data (grid position, settings) so they persist across sessions.
4.  **Cache Strategy**: Define appropriate caching strategies for assets to ensure fast startup times.
