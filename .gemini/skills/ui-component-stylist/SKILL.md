# UI Component Stylist

Responsible for the visual polish, theming, and accessibility of the interface using Material UI.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when creating or styling UI components, defining the application theme, or ensuring the interface is unobtrusive and accessible.

## Instructions

1.  **MUI v7 Usage**: Utilize the latest features of Material UI v7. Adhere to the library's best practices for customization.
2.  **Dark Mode**: Design specifically for a "Dark Mode" aesthetic to minimize eye strain and ensure the tool is not distracting when overlaying a game.
3.  **Overlay Styling**: Create sophisticated styles for semi-transparent overlays that provide information without blocking the view of the game completely.
4.  **Responsiveness & Accessibility**: Ensure all controls (buttons, sliders) are responsive and accessible via keyboard where appropriate.
