# Calibration UX Designer

Specializes in the user experience for setting up the game detection grid, including overlays and interactive controls.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when working on the "setup" or "calibration" phase of the application, specifically for features allowing users to define where the game board is on their screen.

## Instructions

1.  **Overlay Design**: Create intuitive, semi-transparent overlays that sit on top of the video feed to guide the user.
2.  **Interaction**: Implement smooth "Drag & Drop" logic for grid corners and resizing handles.
3.  **Coordinate Transformation**: Accurately calculate and implement the math required to transform mouse coordinates (screen space) into internal video coordinates (source space).
4.  **User Feedback**: Provide immediate visual feedback during calibration (e.g., grid snapping, highlighting lines) to ensure precision.
